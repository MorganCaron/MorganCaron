### Hi there üëã

I'm Morgan Caron, a French software and web developer. I program mainly in C++.

My main projects are:
- [Script](https://github.com/MorganCaron/Script): An object-oriented interpreted programming language for software and video game development;
- [Cora](https://github.com/MorganCaron/Cora): COnscious and Rational Algorithm; ü§ñ(open-source soon)
- [ModularDom](https://github.com/MorganCaron/ModularDom): A TypeScript library for the creation of single-page web applications.

You can find more information about my projects on [my Trello](https://trello.com/b/vpnv9IxH/todo) (in French).

You can support my work financially by becoming a sponsor.
I hope one day to be able to invest full time in my open-source projects and make a living from them. üíñ
